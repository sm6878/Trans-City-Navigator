# Trans-City-Navigator

The Trans City Navigator provides its user with the shortest path between the given source and destination.

The project Trans- City Navigator tends to reduce the wastage of time encountered by people in day to day commuting. The project also helps the unassuming commuter in getting the 
routes from one place to other. 

The project intends to display the shortest and other paths after obtaining source and destination location from the user. It also gives distance travelled while using different 
routes. Our project works on pre- fed city map, which can also be changed and a new city map can also be added.

The following Data Structures and Algorithms have been used to create this project : 

1) GRAPH TRAVERSAL-(BFS & DFS) : For finding the city routes 
2) KRUSKAL & PRIMâ€™S ALGORITHM : For finding the shortest routes 
3) TREES & GRAPH : The City Map Structure 
4) LINKED LIST : Storing the adequate routes 
5) MERGE, QUICK SORT : Sorting and arranging the paths in terms of distance b/w the source and destination sites. 
6) FILE HANDLING : Storing the shortest and other paths 
7) STACKS & QUEUES : Temporary Storage and for implementing Shortest Path and other Sorting Algorithms.
